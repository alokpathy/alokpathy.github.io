Hi, I'm Alok! I'm an incoming CS Ph.D. student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

Broadly, I am interested in designing algorithms and programming models that leverage high-performance systems, particularly heterogeneous systems. My work is supported by the [NSF Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

Before coming to Berkeley, I worked with [Oded Green](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C_7l2roAAAAJ&hl=en) in [David Bader](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/)'s HPC lab at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) (Go Jackets!).
