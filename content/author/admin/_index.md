I'm a Member of Technical Staff at [Essential AI](https://essential.ai/), where we are pushing the capabilities of fully open-source LLMs. 

I recently graduated with a CS Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. My [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/9ae79d3983177133d1946ba7d213af1d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) focused on scaling large GNN models and applying them to sciences, particularly [high-energy physics](https://atlas.cern/). I was very thankful to be advised by the wonderful [Aydın Buluç](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/index.html) and [Kathy Yelick](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yelick/) during this time. In the past, I worked on accelerating graph analytics on GPUs with [Oded Green](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C_7l2roAAAAJ&hl=en) and [David Bader](https://davidbader.net/) at Georgia Tech. My work has been supported by the [NSF Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
