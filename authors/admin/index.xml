      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Member of Technical Staff at Essential AI, where we are pushing the capabilities of fully open-source LLMs.
I recently graduated with a CS Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. My dissertation focused on scaling large GNN models and applying them to sciences, particularly high-energy physics. I was very thankful to be advised by the wonderful Aydın Buluç and Kathy Yelick during this time. In the past, I worked on accelerating graph analytics on GPUs with Oded Green and David Bader at Georgia Tech.</description>
