Hi, I'm Alok! I'm a 2nd-year CS Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Aydın Buluç](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/index.html) and [Kathy Yelick](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yelick/). I am affiliated with the [PASSION Lab](https://passion.lbl.gov/), the [BeBOp Group](https://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/), and [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/).

Broadly, I am interested in designing algorithms that leverage high-performance systems, particularly heterogeneous systems. I am currently interested in scaling graph-representation learning in distributed environments. In the past, I worked on accelerating graph analytics on GPUs. My work is supported by the [NSF Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I am also passionate about science communication. To that end, I write for the [Berkeley Science Review](https://berkeleysciencereview.com/article/tracking-your-e-missions/).

Before coming to Berkeley, I worked with [Oded Green](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C_7l2roAAAAJ&hl=en) in [David Bader](https://davidbader.net/)'s HPC lab at Georgia Tech (Go Jackets!).
